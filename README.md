//Brief Summary of Program
Mainform loads in all folders(in the tree view) and corresponding photos(in the list view) into the program. Photos can then be edited by double clicking them. The edits include Inverting the colors of the image, tinting the image with different colors, and changing the brightness of the image.
//Any Known Bugs

Robert -> With respect to switching between large directories of jpg, there is a little 
          stuttering, but it does generate the list correctly.
          
Robert -> Also the Loading Form when inverting colors does generate and work Except for the Close. The CLOSE does not Work. It will Crash
